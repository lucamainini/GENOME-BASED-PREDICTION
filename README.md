# GENOME-BASED PREDICTION OF BREAST CANCER CELL RESPONSE
> Given the genomic features of a cell line, can we predict if it is sensitive or resistant to a particular treatment? <br>
  Is it possible to identify a minimal set of features (genes) that predict the response?

## Description
Here the results of a statistical analysis of breast cancer data are presented. The relevant datasets used for this project can be found through the [Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) database. The CCLE is a multi-institutional effort to develop a comprehensive database for varying types of cancer. Our main **objective was to infer which genomic aspects most influence the sensitivity to antitumoral drugs.**

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to understand the link between the genetic and physiological data of a patient and how efficiently cancer-treating drugs perform on their cells. First, patients were divided into groups based on the effectiveness of the treatments on their cells. Then, we tried to explain these groups with their gene expression.
To simplify the project scope, the analysis is strictly limited to patients having breast cancer, as opposed to all cancers which were present in the main dataset.
