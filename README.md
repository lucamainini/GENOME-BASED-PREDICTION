  Is it possible to identify a minimal set of features (genes) that predict the response?

## Description
Here the results of a statistical analysis of breast cancer data are presented. The relevant datasets used for this project can be found through the [Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) database. The CCLE is a multi-institutional effort to develop a comprehensive database for varying types of cancer.
